#About

Welcome to docs.thetechguy.com, a resource for all things endpoint management, application packaging, and the occasional mad scientist-level 
personal tech tinkering project! Here, we dive into the nuts and bolts of IT with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store—except the candy 
is made of code, scripts, and gadgets that may or may not have a mind of their own.

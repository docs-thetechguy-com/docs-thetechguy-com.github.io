## **Hardware Requirements**

<center><img src="../assets/hardware.png" alt="hardware" width="750" /></center>


- [Orange Pi 5 (OPi5)](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5.html)

	!!!note
		OPi5 supports ARMv8.2. Windows 11 requires ARMv8.1

		As of June 2024, Orange Pi 5 Pro is not supported by this project.

- [Black ball bearing fan - DC 5V sleeve dupont 40x40x10mm](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807362230220.html)

- USB hub ([uni USB C to USB Hub 4 Ports](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P3GDLVP))

	!!!note  
		USB hub is requires as only the vertical USB-A ports will work for keyboard and mouse. Any USB hub may work, this is just want I had. 

- USB-C to USB-A adapter for hub

- NVMe drive (such as a [SABRENT 1TB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2242](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XVTRFF8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1))

	!!!note
		Must be a NVMe M.2 drive. You may find some NVMe drives do not have driver support. I have found SABENT brand is supported.	

		There is no driver support for All M.2 SATA drives.

- Run `WoR.exe` as an Administrator
	- Set wizard mode = Select show all options
	- Select storage device and device type = Raspberry Pi 2/3
	- Select ISO image and Windows Pro build

	- Leave defaults for configuration
	- Click Install
	- Wait for the Windows offline install to complete. Takes ~5 minutes
	- Click Finish 

### **Windows Setup**

- Install NVMe drive into the bottom of your OPi5
- Power-on OPi5

	!!!note
		System may be slow while .NET Optimization runs 

- Complete the OOBE process

## **Option 2: Install Windows 11 24H2 or later using WinPE**

- Download and extract v1.1.0 or later of the [PE-based installer](https://worproject.com/downloads#windows-on-raspberry-pe-based-installer)

	!!!note
		Ignore that it says Raspberry. This was originally built for Raspberry Pi devices, but development has been extended to support Orange Pi devices)

- Plug a separate 16+ GB USB drive into your PC (This is for the installation media and not the NVMe drive)

- Download latest [rufus portable](https://rufus.ie/en/#download)

- Open Rufus as an Administrator, verify USB drive was detected, and drag ISO onto Rufus app

- Click Start

- Check both remove requirements and both disable options, then click OK

### **Windows Setup**

- Install USB drive into USB hub connected to the OPi5

- Power-on OPi5

- Press ESC to get the boot options

- Select Boot Manager > USB

- You should see the orange pi logo and after 30 seconds a Recovery screen will display

- Press F8 > 7 to disable driver signature enforcement

- Wait for WinPE to load

- Select Windows 11 and check I agree everything will be deleted

- Click I don't have a product key

- Delete all Disk 0 partitions

- Select Disk 0 Unallocated Space and click Next

- Summary: Install Windows 11 Pro, Keep nothing

- Click Install

- Wait for Windows to install, after restart you can remove the USB drive

- ***Currently this is not working and just hangs after restart***


## **Known Issues**

- When booting the loading circle locks up and Windows never loads. After a few power cycles it clears.

- BSOD when booting. This could be a sign that the storage driver (stornvme.sys) has been overwritten by Windows\Windows Update.

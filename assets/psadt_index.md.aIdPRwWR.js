It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience and improves installation success rates.<sup>[<a href="https://psappdeploytoolkit.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1</a>]</sup></p><p>    <img src="https://psappdeploytoolkit.com/images/psadt-dark-navheader.svg" alt="Image"></p><p>The PSAppDeployToolkit can be used to replace your WiseScript, VBScript and Batch wrapper scripts with one versatile, re-usable and extensible tool.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Easy To Use</strong> – Any PowerShell beginner can use the template and the functions provided with the Toolkit to perform application deployments.</li><li><strong>Consistent</strong> – Provides a consistent look and feel for all application deployments, regardless of complexity.</li><li><strong>Powerful</strong> – Provides a set of functions to perform common deployment tasks, such as installing or uninstalling multiple applications, prompting users to close apps, setting registry keys, copying files, etc.</li><li><strong>User Interface</strong> – Provides user interaction through customizable user interface dialogs boxes, progress dialogs and balloon tip notifications.</li><li><strong>Localized</strong> – The UI is localized in several languages and more can easily be added using the XML configuration file.</li><li><strong>Integration</strong> – Integrates well with ConfigMgr (SCCM); provides installation and uninstallation deployment types with options on how to handle exit codes, such as suppressing reboots or returning a fast retry code.</li><li><strong>Updatable</strong> – The logic engine and functions are separated from per-application scripts, so that you can update the toolkit when a new version is released and maintain backwards compatibility with your deployment scripts.</li><li><strong>Extensible</strong> – The Toolkit can be easily extended to add custom scripts and functions.</li><li><strong>Helpful</strong> – The Toolkit provides detailed logging of all actions performed and even includes a graphical console to browse the help documentation for the Toolkit functions.</li></ul><h2 id="functionality" tabindex="-1">Functionality <a class="header-anchor" href="#functionality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Functionality&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="user-interface" tabindex="-1">User Interface <a class="header-anchor" href="#user-interface" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;User Interface&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>An interface to prompt the user to close specified applications that are open prior to starting the application deployment.
